# Introduction

While at Space Challenges Bootcamp 2021 our team of 8 was assigned the task to build a ground station.  

The project would have been considered successful if we successfully captured, demodulated and deframed telemtry data from one of EnduroSat's educational cubesats - QMR-KWT.  

While our design documents describes everything on the technical side (including mission, system, subsystem requirements, design, implementation and evaluation) in this repository I will go over the step-by-step methodology used for the signal processing (which Vladimir and Dimitar were responsible for, but not limited to).

That would include even more detailed steps, than those presented in the design document, how we tested the systems, and problems faced, including the ways we overcame them.

Additionally I will also post here our results from the project altogether and our presentation which we held in front of most of EnduroSat's team and a special guest on the bootcamp - Pete Worden, former NASA Ames Research center director, and current Chairman of the Breakthrough Prize Foundation.
